# Text-Summarizer--NLP-Project

## Problem statement - 
To create text summarization project using NLP and transformers. Also learn how various processes or pipelines work, and get and overview of how an end to end project is deployed.
For this project, we utilized the Pegasus model fine-tuned on the CNN/DailyMail dataset, available on Hugging Face's Model Hub. Pegasus is an advanced model specifically designed for abstractive summarization tasks, enabling the generation of concise and coherent summaries from extensive text data. The model was accessed via the Hugging Face API to integrate its capabilities into our project seamlessly.
